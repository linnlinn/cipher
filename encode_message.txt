I then lounged down the street and found,
as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down
by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing
down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of
half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information
as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen
other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least
interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.

Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well
to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman
with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all
the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't
pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only
caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with
a face that a man might die for.

My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others
were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses
were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried
into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had
followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with
them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I
lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
